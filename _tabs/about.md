## Who Am I?
Hi! My name is Alice, or Jin Hao. I am a 17 year old Singaporean student interested in Cybersecurity and Web Development.\
\
I participate in a lot of CTFs, and currently specialize in Web, with a bit of experience in Crypto. Currently, I'm interested in expanding intro Rev, although I have not found much time lately\
\
Apart from techy stuff, I'm also very passionate about language! Currently, I am fluent in Chinese and English, with roughly a N3 standard of Japanese. I picked up Korean for a month or two before dropping it due to other intersts, although I hope to revisit it in the future. While I may not be the most profficient learner, I genuinely appreciate the process of learning and mastering languages.\
\
As for my hobbies, I love reading and gaming! I have a very unhealthy obsession with competitive games such as Tetris and Chess. D: I can only thank my crappy setup for saving me from a League addiction T_T


## Accademic Qualifications
I am currently taking my GSCE A levels for Computing, Physics, Math, and Economics.\
I hold a GCSE O level certification for Japanese and Higher Chinese, and am currently furthering my studies in the former under my own free time. \
I have undergone and graduated the Electrical & Computer Engineering Principles & Practice Module (EE111B) under NUS with an A grade
